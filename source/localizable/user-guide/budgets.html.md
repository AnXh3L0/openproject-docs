# Budgets

You can create and manage a **project budget** in OpenProject to keep track of your available and spent costs in a project.

You can add planned **unit costs** as well as **labor costs** for the project.

Then, you will assign work packages to a budgets. If you logg time or costs to this work package the costs will booked to this budget and show the percentage spent for a project budget.
